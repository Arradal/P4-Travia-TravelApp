# Travia - A Travel Companion App
This project is the result of a 4th semester project at Interaction Design Aalborg University. The theme of the project was 'Connecting People', and revolves around developing a functional interactive prototype.

A high-fidelity prototype was constructed based on chosen requirements and created the foundation for Travia - a travel app for Android phones with the intention of connecting solo travellers through meetups and activities.

The concept was implemented in Xamarin.Android with C# using Firebase as database.

Finally, the solution was evaluated through a usability test with potential users, to see which requirements were met and to discover potential improvements to the app.
